# Pokemon
Welcome to my Pokemon battle simulator with a fun original storyline and characters!

Start date: Dec 2020

Total hours so far approx: 40

** all characters are designed with https://www.deviantart.com/jcling/art/Pokemon-Trainer-Creator-401165483 **

** all music and sound effects are from the original pokemon ost **

** all sprites are from pokemon showdown **

** wallpapers/backgrounds and gifs are found from multiple sources, have yet to cite **

Located in the exciting region "Eula", a secluded elite region bursting with competitive hearts and energetic souls willing to train and compete to become the next world champion.
This game, coded entirely in HTML, CSS and Javascript currently comes in 2 modes. As a huge pokemon fan, I am so excited to present to you this game. 

# Mode 1: Eula Elite Four
In this mode, you will challenge the region's top ace trainers - the Elite Four - a group of 4 highly skilled trainers mastered in one element each. Upon beating each one, you may challenge the Regional Eula Champion and claim the title of Champion of Eula!
Unlike regular pokemon, in this mode, each pokemon is monotype and there are no stat or condition changing modes. All moves deal damage, either physical attack (ATK) or special attack (SPA) which will be indicated by red/blue outlines. There will be an instructions page before the challenge begins. 


# Mode 2: World Challenge Cup
*** This mode is in progress ***
Not only does this mode focus on better formatting and structure of Mode 1, revamping, regrouping and tidying up a lot of the code, there is a lot more content.
This mode is unlockable once you beat the first mode. You will be provided a special password to enter into the second mode once you become Champion of Eula. 
Representing Eula, you will be facing in a tournament style challenge where you can face off against 4 out of 15 different regional champions to claim the World Champion title. 
These trainers are different as they are not limited to one type of pokemon. However, in this mode, be mindful that dual types do not exist (each pokemon is monotype but the trainer may not specialize in only one type of pokemon). I will be adding a lot more interactive dialogue, personality into the characters, unique soundtracks and wallpapers.

*** the biggest difference with this mode, is that stat and condition moves will be included. Pokemon may be frozen/poisoned/paralyzed/burned/asleep/confused and pokemon's stats such as atk/spa/def/spd/speed may increase or decrease. This is a big challenge for me and requires changing a lot of my previous code
